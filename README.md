PROCEDURE:

i. Forward Bias condition
1. Connect the circuit as per the given circuit diagram shown in figure:1
2. Vary the power supply voltage in such a way that the voltmeter reading is 0.1V.
Note the corresponding current reading in Ammeter.
3. Repeat step-2 by increasing the voltage in steps of 0.1V, till 1.0V.
4. Plot a graph taking voltage (V) on X axis and current (I) on Y axis.
   
ii. Reverse bias condition
1. Connect the circuit as per the circuit diagram shown in figure:2
2. Vary the power supply voltage in such a way that the volt meter reading is 1V.
Note the corresponding current reading in Ammeter.
3. Repeat step-2 by increasing the voltage in steps of 1V, till 20V.
4. Plot a graph taking the voltage (V) on X-axis and current (I) on Y-axis
